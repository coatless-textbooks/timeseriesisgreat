# Basic Models

## White Noise

The process name of white noise has meaning in the notion of colors of noise. Specifically, the white noise is a process that mirrors white light's flat frequency spectrum. So, the process has equal frequencies in any interval of time.

*Definition:* **White Noise**

$w_t$ or $\varepsilon _t$ is a **white noise process** if $w_t$ are uncorrelated identically distributed random variables with
$E\left[w_t\right] = 0$ and $Var\left[w_t\right] = \sigma ^2$, for all $t$. We can represent this algebraically as:
$$y_t = w_t,$$
where ${w_t}\mathop \sim \limits^{id} WN\left( {0,\sigma _w^2} \right)$

Now, if the $w_t$ are **Normally (Gaussian) distributed**, then the process is known as a **Gaussian White Noise** e.g. ${w_t}\mathop \sim \limits^{iid} N\left( {0,{\sigma ^2}} \right)$

To generate gaussian white noise use:

```{r generate_white_noise, cache=TRUE}
```


## Moving Average Process of Order q = 1 a.k.a MA(1)

*Definition:* **Moving Average Process of Order (q = 1)**

The concept of a **Moving Average Process of Order q** is a way to remove "noise" and emphasize the signal. The moving average achieves this by taking the local averages of the data to produce a new smoother time series series. The newly created time series is more descriptive, but it does influence the dependence within the time series.

This process is generally denoted as **MA(1)** and is defined as:

$${y_t} = {\theta _1}{w_{t - 1}} + {w_t},$$

where ${w_t}\mathop \sim \limits^{iid} WN\left( {0,\sigma _w^2} \right)$

```{r generate_ma1, cache=TRUE}
```

## Drift

*Definition:* **Drift**

A **drift process** has two components: time and a slope. As more points are accumlated over time, the drift will match the common slope form.

Specifically, the drift process has the following form:
$$y_t = y_{t-1} + \delta $$
with the initial condition $y_0 = c$.

The process can be simplified using **backsubstitution** to being:
\[\begin{aligned}
  {y_t} &= {y_{t - 1}} + \delta \\
   &= \left( {{y_{t - 2}} + \delta} \right) + \delta \\
   &\vdots  \\
   &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {\delta}  + y_0 \\ 
   {y_t} &= t{\delta} + c  \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

Again, note that a drift is similar to the slope-intercept form a linear line. e.g. $y = mx + b$.

To generate a drift use:

```{r generate_drift, cache=TRUE}
```

## Random Walk

In 1906, Karl Pearson coined the term 'random walk' and demonstrated that "the most likely place to find a drunken walker is somewhere near his starting point." Empirical evidence of this phenomenon is not too hard to find on a Friday night in Champaign.

*Definition:* **Random Walk**

A **random walk** is defined as a process where the current value of a variable is composed of the past value plus an error term that is a white noise. In algebraic form,
$$y_t = y_{t-1} + w_t$$
with the initial condition $y_0 = c$.

The process can be simplified using **backsubstitution** to being:
\[\begin{aligned}
  {y_t} &= {y_{t - 1}} + {w_t} \\
   &= \left( {{y_{t - 2}} + {w_{t - 1}}} \right) + {w_t} \\
   &\vdots  \\
  {y_t} &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{w_i}} + y_0 =  \sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{w_i}} + c \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

To generate a random walk, we use:

```{r generate_rw, cache=TRUE}
```

## Random Walk with Drift

In the previous case of a random walk, we assumed that drift, $\delta$, was equal to 0. What happens to the random walk if the drift is not equal to zero? That is, what happens with the initial condition $y_0 = c$?

\[\begin{aligned}
  {y_t} &= {y_{t - 1}} + {w_t} + \delta \\
   &= \left( {{y_{t - 2}} + {w_{t - 1}} + \delta} \right) + {w_t} + \delta \\
   &\vdots  \\
  {y_t} &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {\left({w_{i} + \delta}\right)} + y_0 =  \sum\limits_{i = 1}^t {{w_i}} + t\delta + c \\ 
\end{aligned} \]

To generate a random walk with drift we use:

```{r generate_rwd, cache=TRUE}
```

Notice the difference the drift makes upon the random walk:

```{r compare_rw_and_rwd, cache=TRUE}
```

## Autoregressive Process of Order p = 1 a.k.a AR(1)

*Definition:* **Autoregressive Process of Order p = 1**

This process is generally denoted as **AR(1)** and is defined as:
${y_t} = {\phi _1}{y_{t - 1}} + {w_t},$

where ${w_t}\mathop \sim \limits^{iid} WN\left( {0,\sigma _w^2} \right)$

If $\phi _1 = 1$, then the process is equivalent to a random walk.

The process can be simplified using **backsubstitution** to being:
\[\begin{aligned}
 {y_t} &= {\phi _t}{y_{t - 1}} + {w_t} \\
   &= {\phi _1}\left( {{\phi _1}{y_{t - 2}} + {w_{t - 1}}} \right) + {w_t} \\
   &= \phi _1^2{y_{t - 2}} + {\phi _1}{w_{t - 1}} + {w_t} \\
   &\vdots  \\
   &= {\phi ^t}{y_0} + \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{t - 1} {\phi _1^i{w_{t - i}}}
\end{aligned}\]

```{r generate_ar1, cache=TRUE}
```
